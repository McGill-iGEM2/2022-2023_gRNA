# gRNA
### 07/02/2023 
To-Do:
1) Generate gRNA based on sequence
Iterate through every 31bp window and find the complementary gRNA
2) Retrieve values for GC content, T_melt, etc...
3) Lit review -> rank factors + wet lab results
Determine what variables we want to measure for each of those (melting temp, etc.) and get those values for each gRNA
4) Filter generated gRNA based on criteria
